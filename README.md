# LemonReport
An advanced, yet easy to use mass reporting tool for Instagram written in Python. Needs a "combolist" of accounts in format "username:password" and a list of proxies to use.<br>
This tool works on XPATHs, which are sort of the last resort, expect it to not work properly most of the time. No I won't be fixing it
<i>No guarantee this will always work. Instagram changes their front-end quite often</i>
# How to use
1. Locate your file with account combos
2. Locate your file with proxies
3. Run either main.py for reporting an account or post.py for reporting a post
